# Button

**Button pairing**

- almost all of the time you should be using the pairing of regular button with a background and an outline of that version next to it
- if its the same level then i would expect to see 2 full background colours but different colours e.g. green vs blue
- if its different level then i would expect to see 1 full background colour e.g. orange button. the second less important one as an outlined version

**Don't use with modals *yet***

- don't use kc-buttons on modal footers to preserve consistency across modals
- eventually modals will be in keychain and we can enforce button consistency across all modals
